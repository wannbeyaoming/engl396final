# FAQ and Support

### Why is the program not running?

You may be running the wrong file. Check that you are running the “app.R” file. The image below shows an example of what RStudio looks like when the "app.R" file is selected.

### Why is it unable to read my data file?
* Within your functions, you may be reading the wrong file name. Check that your data file name and the name given to the function is consistent.
  * If you look closely at some of the functions reading the album data, you may notice that it is reading a specific name. For example, in the albums_by_year function, the function is expecting to read a file named "album-rankings.csv". ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8df2d632-6562-4e08-b894-38b1517f16b0)

* Your file may not be in the data folder of the project. Check that your CSV file is in the data file of your project. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c5c7c87-7ed0-4d6e-8f24-5c441b4fdd47)


### Why are my functions not running?
* The libraries that the functions need to run may not have been imported correctly. Check that your files have the right import syntax. An example file is shown below. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f1025a6-05d9-4f5f-969a-309936c38b7c)
